# Tic Tac Toe Project 3

## In this project, I implemented these features:
1. Graphical user interface from Project 2 (Changed the main.java compeletely and use classes and controller to implement)
2. Used hashmap to store user data (press quit to store data). Data are saved under project3, hashmap.ser. 
3. Add sound effects for win, loss and draw. (I used relative file directories to link to sound files mp3, wma under src folder)
4. Works for both play against computer and two player mode.
5. All input exceptions are checked for both players.
6. Locations are checked (from project2). 
7. Tried to implement emoji, but javafx cannot render them correctly. Default computer marker "C".
8. Tried to implement timer, but failed.
